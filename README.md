# Contact-User-LWC

This repository contains a solution to a coding challenge that satisfies three requirements: 

Requirement 1
  Develop a LWC that will be placed on a Contact record page.
  Run an apex method that gets the user record information based on the email address of the Contact. 
  The apex method should return a wrapper class object back to the LWC. The LWC will display the user information if found,
  alternatively will display appropriate messages if a user is not found or if the Contact record does not have an email address.
 
Requirement 2
  Write a test class for the apex class written in requirement 1.

Requirement 3
  Control visibility of the component to only allow users with a “System Administrator” profile to have visibility.

The remainder of this README will contain documentation on the solution design with justification of why certain design choices have been made.
